## Schema

### Required

- `b64_age_data` (String) Insert your b64 encoded age encrypted secret here, use `age -R ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub -R ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub secret.file | base64 -w0` to generate the value. Currently only supports string files.
- `secret_name` (String) Name of the secret, has to be unique for the target_pve.

### Read-Only

- `plain_data` (String) During resource creation the provider looks at the env var CLOUD_AGE_SSH_KEY_FILE to load file for initial decryption. Once the resource is created you can here access the unencrypted secret, this is for convenience sake. You can also use the pxc_cloud_secret datasource to access it.
